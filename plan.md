### Voice Processing Pipeline

1. **Audio Recording**: Expo Audio API (local recording)
2. **Speech-to-Text**: expo-speech (local processing - no API costs)
3. **Exercise Name Recognition**: 
   - Comprehensive exercise database with aliases/synonyms
   - Fuzzy matching using fuse.js library
   - NLP to handle variations ("chest press" → "bench press")
4. **Data Extraction**:
   - Parse sets, reps, weights, rest times
   - Handle natural language variations
   - Extract temporal information ("90 seconds rest", "2 minutes")

### Exercise Database Strategy

Create a comprehensive local database with 1000+ exercises across categories:

#### Strength Training (400+ exercises)
- **Compound Movements**: Squat, Deadlift, Bench Press, Pull-up variants
- **Isolation**: Bicep curls, tricep extensions, calf raises
- **Equipment Types**: Barbell, dumbbell, machine, cable, bodyweight

#### Yoga & Flexibility (300+ exercises)
- **Yoga Poses**: Downward dog, warrior poses, child's pose, sun salutations
- **Stretching**: Dynamic and static stretches for all muscle groups  
- **Mobility**: Hip circles, arm swings, leg swings
- **Meditation**: Breathing exercises, guided meditation

#### Database Structure:
- **Primary Names**: "Downward Facing Dog", "Treadmill Running", "Barbell Squat"
- **Common Aliases**: ["downward dog", "down dog"] for "Downward Facing Dog"
- **Muscle Group Mapping**: Treadmill Running → ["legs", "glutes", "cardiovascular"]
- **Equipment Tags**: ["yoga mat"], ["treadmill"], ["barbell", "squat rack"]
- **Movement Patterns**: "push", "pull", "squat", "hinge", "cardio", "flexibility"

//     { reps: 8, weight: 225, restTime: 120 },
//     { reps: 6, weight: 225, restTime: 120 }
//   ]
// }

// Cardio with Duration
// Input: "I ran on the treadmill for 30 minutes at 6.5 mph"
// Output: {
//   exercise: "Treadmill Running",
//   sets: [{ duration: 1800, pace: 553 }], // 553 seconds per mile
//   totalDuration: 1800,
//   distance: 3.25 // calculated
// }

// Yoga/Flexibility
// Input: "I held downward dog for 1 minute, then did 3 sets of child's pose for 30 seconds each"

//     sets: [{ duration: 60 }]
//   },
//   {
//     exercise: "Child's Pose", 
//     sets: [
//       { duration: 30 },
//       { duration: 30 },
//       { duration: 30 }
//     ]
//   }
// ]

// HIIT/Complex
// Input: "I did 4 rounds of burpees, 45 seconds on, 15 seconds rest"
// Output: {
//   exercise: "Burpees",
//   sets: [
//     { duration: 45, restTime: 15 },
//     { duration: 45, restTime: 15 },

- **Recovery Timing**: "Your last heavy squat day was Monday. You're perfectly recovered for another leg session."
- **Injury Prevention**: "I noticed you've been doing a lot of pushing exercises. Let's balance with some pulling movements."

### Coach's Daily Check-ins
```
Morning Greeting: "Good morning! Ready to crush today's workout? 
Your consistency this week has been incredible - 4 workouts so far!"

Post-Workout: "Phenomenal session! That bench press progression is paying off. 
You hit 185lbs for 3 sets - that's a new personal best for volume!"

Recovery Planning: "Based on today's heavy lower body work, I recommend:
• 25-30g protein within 30 minutes (your muscles are hungry!)
• Focus on quad stretching tonight
• Plan an easy walk or yoga tomorrow
• Next leg day: wait 48-72 hours for full recovery"

Weekly Summary: "This week you crushed it! 5 workouts, 3.2 hours total, 
and hit PRs on both bench press and squat. I'm seeing real strength gains!"
